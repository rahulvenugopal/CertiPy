Many a times we create a certificate template using Scribus or Powerpoint :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

There will be a name list containing all the names of participants. Now the daunting task is to create individual certificates (in PDF/Image formats)

Doing this manually is daunting, error prone and waste of time when you are yearning for some sleep on the last day of a conference

IF you speak `parseltongue` :snake: you are in luck to automate this boring stuff

---

 You begin by creating an empty folder called `certificate_generated`, an good quality template file of certificate in any image format and a `namelist.csv` containing names of participants

This is the template image and we will be filling in names

These are the generated images/PDFs. We can style the text in lot many ways

I have added a simple alignment options by tweaking text length (Couldn't get the align option to work neatly)

We can add multiple texts (like registration number) by extending the script!
