# CertiPy
Many a times we create a certificate template using Scribus or Powerpoint :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

There will be a name list containing all the names of participants. Now the daunting task is to create individual certificates (in PDF/Image formats)

Doing this manually is daunting, error prone and waste of time when you are yearning for some sleep on the last day of a conference

IF you speak `parseltongue` :snake: you are in luck to automate this boring stuff

Enter `certiPy` :tada:  <img src="https://github.com/rahulvenugopal/CertiPy/blob/main/certi.png" width="40px" />

You begin by creating an empty folder called `certificate_generated`, an good quality template file of certificate in any image format and a `namelist.csv` containing names of participants
